# Preview Apps

Preview apps are a way to create fork applications that are built from a Pull Request (Merge Request). Preview apps are only supported for Git repository based projects.

### Enable preview apps
Go to **Projects → Settings** and enable preview apps. Set up which cluster you want to deploy the preview app to. Often times, you'll want to set up a separate cluster so that the preview apps aren't deployed on the same cluster as your production application.
