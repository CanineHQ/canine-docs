# Connect a GitHub project

Canine can deploy any project with a `Dockerfile`, but for this tutorial, we will deploy our example whiteboard application.

Go to [czhu12/whiteboarder](https://github.com/czhu12/whiteboarder) and fork the project to your own GitHub repository.

Navigate to **Projects → + New Project** and give your project a name.

Select your GitHub project by clicking on **Connect GitHub** and selecting your project. It should be something like `<your_username>/whiteboarder`.

Create your project, and it should automatically start building.
