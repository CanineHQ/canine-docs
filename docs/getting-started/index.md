# Quickstart

In this quickstart guide, we're going to deploy a real time, [collaborative whiteboard application](https://whiteboard.canine.sh).

1. Set up a Kubernetes cluster (4 minutes)
2. Connect a Github project (3 minutes)
3. Deploy a Redis database (1 minute)
4. Deploy the collaborative whiteboard application (2 minutes)
5. Configure DNS & LetsEncrypt SSL certificate (2 minutes)

At the end of this quickstart guide, you'll have:

* A publicly accessible, collaborative whiteboard app
* Backed by a Redis database
* Github auto deployments on any code changes
* Zero downtime restarts
* Fully managed SSL certificate

You'll need to own a domain name to complete this tutorial.
