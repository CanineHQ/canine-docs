# Create your first service

A project can have multiple services, which you can think of as processes that run. For a typical web application, you might have a web service and a background job processor service. In this case, we will just create a single web service for our Whiteboarder app.

Navigate to **Projects** **→ Whiteboarder → Services** and click **+ New Service**, select **web**. You can keep all the other settings the same.

Once you've created your first service, click **Deploy**.
